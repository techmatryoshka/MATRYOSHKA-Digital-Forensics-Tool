## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required system privileges for deep analysis (administrator/root recommended)

**Required packages:**
- `psutil >= 5.8.0`
- `sqlite3` (included with Python)
- `pathlib` (included with Python 3.4+)

### Quick Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/techmatryoshka/MATRYOSHKA-Digital-Forensics-Tool.git
cd matryoshka
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Basic Analysis
```bash
# Standard analysis with default settings
python matryoshka.py --analyze

# Analysis with elevated privileges (recommended)
sudo python matryoshka.py --analyze

# Analysis with detailed logging
python matryoshka.py --analyze --log-level DEBUG --log-file analysis.log
```

### Advanced Usage
```bash
# Custom configuration with report export
python matryoshka.py --analyze --config custom_config.json --export-report

# Export existing findings to report
python matryoshka.py --export-report --output detailed_report.json

# Specify custom database and working directory
python matryoshka.py --analyze --db /secure/location/evidence.db --work-dir /tmp/analysis
```

### Configuration File
Create a JSON configuration file for custom settings:

```json
{
  "max_file_size": 104857600,
  "recent_threshold_hours": 2,
  "hash_algorithm": "sha256",
  "max_workers": 4,
  "max_depth_analysis": 1000,
  "suspicious_ports": [4444, 5555, 6666, 31337, 31338, 31339],
  "temp_paths_unix": ["/tmp", "/var/tmp", "/dev/shm"],
  "temp_paths_windows": ["%TEMP%", "%TMP%", "C:\\Windows\\Temp"]
}
```

## Command Line Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--analyze` | Run comprehensive forensic analysis |
| `--export-report` | Export findings in JSON report format |
| `--config FILE` | Use custom configuration file (JSON) |
| `--db FILE` | Custom database file path |
| `--output FILE` | Output file for reports |
| `--log-file FILE` | Log file path |
| `--log-level LEVEL` | Logging level (DEBUG/INFO/WARNING/ERROR) |
| `--work-dir DIR` | Working directory for temporary files |

## Analysis Layers

Matryoshka analyzes systems through multiple detection layers:

### Layer 1: Surface Artifacts
- Recent temporary files and cache entries
- Hidden files and suspicious naming patterns
- File access time analysis with security validation

### Layer 2: Memory Artifacts
- Shared memory segments (/dev/shm analysis)
- Memory-mapped files and IPC traces
- Semaphore and communication artifacts

### Layer 3: Process Remnants
- Orphaned process artifacts and traces
- Hidden directories and communication endpoints
- Process communication shadows

### Layer 4: Network Shadows
- Suspicious network connections and ports
- Covert channel detection on non-standard ports
- Local communication loop analysis

### Layer 5: Registry Artifacts (Windows)
- Ephemeral registry keys and values
- Persistence mechanism detection
- Recently modified registry entries

## Threat Assessment

### Threat Levels
- **CRITICAL**: Multiple high-confidence indicators, potential system compromise
- **HIGH**: Advanced techniques detected, immediate investigation recommended
- **MEDIUM**: Suspicious activities requiring monitoring
- **LOW**: Standard system artifacts with minimal risk

### Confidence Scoring
Confidence levels (0.0-1.0) based on:
- Indicator reliability and correlation
- Evidence quality and completeness
- Analysis depth and verification
- Historical threat intelligence

## Security Features

### Data Protection
- Database files created with restrictive permissions (0o600)
- Secure temporary file handling with automatic cleanup
- Memory-safe operations with configurable limits
- Input validation preventing directory traversal attacks

### Audit Trail
- Complete chain of custody for all evidence
- Session integrity with cryptographic verification
- Comprehensive logging with rotation support
- Evidence provenance tracking

### Access Control
- Privilege level detection and reporting
- Secure database operations with foreign key constraints
- Configuration parameter validation
- Resource usage limits and monitoring

    }
  ]
}
```

## Performance Considerations

- **Concurrent Processing**: Configurable worker threads for directory analysis
- **Memory Management**: File size limits prevent memory exhaustion
- **Database Optimization**: Indexed operations with WAL mode
- **Resource Limits**: Configurable analysis depth to prevent infinite recursion
